"""
Background stream resolver for allmanga-cli.

Manages a thread-safe pool of resolved streams for the current episode and
drives a background worker that resolves remaining mirrors while the user
is already watching.  Extracted from ``app.py`` to keep media concerns
separated from UI/orchestration logic.

Public API
----------
* :func:`clear_streams`        — Reset the stream pool for a new episode.
* :func:`extend_streams`       — Add freshly resolved streams to the pool.
* :func:`publish_stream`       — Add a single stream (dedup + generation guard).
* :func:`stream_snapshot`      — Return a point-in-time copy of the pool.
* :func:`stream_count`         — Return the current pool size.
* :func:`start_bg_resolve`     — Launch the background resolver thread.
* :func:`wait_for_bg`          — Block until the background thread finishes.
