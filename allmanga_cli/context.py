"""
Shared state dataclasses for allmanga-cli.

Replaces the scattered ``globals()`` dict pattern in ``app.py`` with three
focused, typed objects, each with a clear responsibility boundary:

* :class:`CliFlags`    — CLI flags read from ``argparse``; treated as read-only
                         after startup.
* :class:`UiState`     — Per-interaction state that changes as the user hovers
                         over items, types queries, and navigates menus.
* :class:`MachineState`— Mutable locals shared across every state transition in
                         the ``main()`` loop (current episode, selected stream, …).
